=head1 DESCRIPTION

Ubic::Service is the abstract base class for all ubic service classes.

It provides common API for implementing service start/stop operations, custom commands and tuning some metadata properties (C<user()>, C<group()>, C<check_period()>).

=head1 METHODS

=head2 ACTION METHODS

All action methods should return L<Ubic::Result::Class> objects. If action method returns plain string, L<Ubic> will wrap it into result object too.

=over

=item B<start()>

Start service. Should throw exception on failure and string with operation result otherwise.

Starting already running service should do nothing and return C<already running>.

=cut
sub start {
    die "not implemented";
}

=item B<stop()>

Stop service. Should throw exception on failure and string with operation result otherwise.

Stopping already stopped service should do nothing and return C<not running>.

Successful stop of a service B<must> disable this service.

=cut
sub stop {
    die "not implemented";
}

=item B<status()>

Check real status of service.

It should check that service is running correctly and return C<running> if it is so.

=cut
sub status {
    my ($self) = @_;
    die "not implemented";
}

=item B<reload()>

Reload service, if possible.

=cut
sub reload {
    my ($self) = @_;
    return result('unknown', 'not implemented');
}

=back

=head2 METADATA METHODS

All metadata methods are read-only. All of them provide sane defaults.

=over

=item B<port()>

Get port number if service provides a server which uses TCP protocol.

Default is C<undef>.

=cut
sub port {
    my ($self) = @_;
    return; # by default, service has no port
}

=item B<user()>

Should return user from which the service can be controlled and will be running.

Default is C<root>.

=cut
sub user {
    my $self = shift;
    return 'root';
}

=item B<group()>

Get list of groups from which the service can be controlled and will be running.

First group from list will be used as real and effective group id, and other groups will be set as supplementary groups.

Default is list of all groups of user as returned by C<user()> method.

=cut
sub group {
    my $self = shift;
    my $user = $self->user;
    my $main_group = getgrgid((getpwnam $user)[3]);
    setgrent();
    my @groups;
    while (my @grent = getgrent()) {
        my @users = split / /, $grent[3];
        push @groups, $grent[0] if grep { $_ eq $user } @users;
    }
    endgrent();
    return ($main_group, @groups);
}

=item B<check_period()>

Period of checking a service by watchdog in seconds.

Default is 60 seconds and it is unused by ubic-watchdog currently, so don't bother to override it by now :)

=cut
sub check_period {
    my ($self) = @_;
    return 60;
}

=item B<check_timeout()>

Timeout after which watchdog will give up on checking a service and kill itself.

This parameter exists as a precaution against incorrectly implemented C<status()> or C<start()> methods. If C<status()> method hangs, without this timeout, watchdog would stay in memory forever and never get a chance to restart a service.

This parameter is *not* a timeout for querying your service by HTTP or whatever your status check is. Service-specific timeouts should be configured by other means.

Default value is 600 seconds. It should not be changed unless you have a very good reason to do so (i.e., your service is so horribly slow that it can't start in 10 minutes).

=cut
sub check_timeout {
    return 600;
}

=back

=head2 CUSTOM COMMAND METHODS

Services can define custom commands which don't fit into usual C<start/stop/restart/status> set.

=over

=item B<custom_commands()>

Can return list of service's custom commands, if such are exist.

=cut
sub custom_commands {
    return ();
}

=item B<do_custom_command($command)>

Should execute specified command, if it is supported.

=cut
sub do_custom_command {
    die "No such command";
}

=back

=head2 NAME METHODS

These methods usually should not be overriden by service classes. They are usually used by code which loads service (i.e. some L<Ubic::Multiservice>) to associate service with its name.

=over

=item B<name()>

=item B<name($new_name)>

Name of service.

Each service with the same parent should have an unique name.

In case of subservices, this method should return the most lower-level name.

Service implementation classes shouldn't override this or other C<*_name> methods; it's usually a service's loader job to set them correctly.

=cut
sub name($;$) {
    my ($self, $name) = @_;
    if (defined $name) {
        $self->{name} = $name;
    }
    else {
        return $self->{name};
    }
}

=item B<full_name()>

Fully qualified name of service.

Each service must have a unique full_name.

Full name is a concatenation of service's short C<name> and service's <parent_name>.

=cut
sub full_name($) {
    my ($self) = @_;
    my $parent_name = $self->parent_name;
    if (defined $parent_name) {
        return $parent_name.".".$self->name;
    }
    else {
        return $self->name;
    }
}

=item B<parent_name()>

=item B<parent_name($new_parent_name)>

Get/set name of service's parent.

Service's loader (i.e. some kind of L<Ubic::Multiservice>) is responsible for calling this method immediately after service's construction as C<< $service->parent_name($self->full_name) >>.

=cut
sub parent_name($;$) {
    my ($self, $name) = @_;
    if (defined $name) {
        $self->{parent_name} = $name;
    }
    else {
        return $self->{parent_name};
    }
}

=back

=head1 FUTURE DIRECTIONS

Current API for custom commands is inconvenient and don't support parameterized commands. It needs some refactoring.

Requiring every service to inherit from this class can be seen as undesirable by some programmers, especially by those who prefer to use Moose and roles.
If you know how to make this API more role-friendly without too much of converting pains, please contact us at ubic-perl@googlegroups.com or at irc://irc.perl.org#ubic.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<Ubic::Service::Skeleton> - implement simple start/stop/status methods, and ubic will care about everything else.

L<Ubic::Service::Common> - just like Skeleton, but all code can be passed to constructor as sub references.

L<Ubic::Service::SimpleDaemon> - give it any binary and it will make service from it.
