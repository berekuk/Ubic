         - log status obtained by status check, instead of just logging 'service is broken'
        * POD improvements:
         - Ubic::Manual::Intro
         - Ubic::Manual::Multiservices
         - various POD fixes

1.28    2011-04-21
        * 'ubic status' always shows non-cached statuses if called by root
        * ubic.ping status now uses sane timeout when it checks service via http

1.27    2011-04-17
        * ubic-admin script:
         - system-wide setup with one command 'ubic-admin setup'
         - home directory setup with the same 'ubic-admin setup' command
         - batch-mode with flag "--batch-mode"
        * configurable default_user (very helpful for home directory setup)
        * 'ubic status' changes:
         - real status will be checked and printed if current user is equal
           to service user
         - "Not a root, printing cached statuses" message removed;
           instead, 'ubic status' will print "[cached]" note for every cached status
        * ubic-ping service renamed to ubic.ping
        * ubic-watchdog and ubic-update now run as ubic.watchdog and ubic.update services
        instead of cron jobs; "ubic-watchdog ubic.watchdog" cron job is still recommended.
        * ubic-periodic script for recurrent job running

1.26    2011-04-10
        Hotfix release (https://github.com/berekuk/Ubic/issues/12):
        * don't depend on Win32 modules
        * stale Win32 code removed
        (it didn't work anyway, so there is no point in packaging it in CPAN releases).

1.25    2011-03-31
        * MacOSX support (and probably other POSIX systems too, including FreeBSD)
        * lots of refactoring:
         - Ubic::Daemon::OS modules family for OS-specific daemonization tasks
         - Ubic::Credentials::OS modules family for OS-specific user/group tasks

1.24    2011-02-23
        * ubic-watchdog: change process name while checking specific service
        * check that uid change was successful before calling service action methods
        * default check_timeout() lowered from 10 minutes to 1 minute

1.23    2010-12-02
        * ubic-ping: 404 message content fixed
        * ubic-watchdog:

         - another alarm before compiling services

1.22    2010-11-07
        * Ubic::Multiservice:
         - default implementation of 'has_simple_service' method

         (set_ubic_dir still remains in code for backward compatibility)
         - get_data_dir() and get_service_dir() methods
         - UBIC_LOCK_DIR, UBIC_TMP_DIR and UBIC_WATCHDOG_DIR env variables are deprecated;
         UBIC_DIR variable or set_data_dir() method should be used instead
         - bugfix in forked_call() method - it thrown "temp file not found after fork" exception occasionally in some cases
         - more consistent params validation in many methods
        * ubic-watchdog improvements:
         - separate non-blocking per-service lock (http://github.com/berekuk/ubic/issues#issue/1)
         - ubic-watchdog can now check selected set of services by name or glob
         - ubic-watchdog kills itself after $service->check_timeout() seconds
        * deprecated Ubic::Catalog module removed (it was renamed into Ubic::Multiservice long time ago)

        * documentation improvements

1.19    2010-09-14
        * ubic-watchdog always uses Ubic->status interface to check service status

1.18    2010-09-14
        * critical bugfix: ubic-watchdog correctly interpret extended statuses
        (thanks to Sawyer X for noticing this, see http://github.com/berekuk/Ubic/issues#issue/7)
        * Ubic::Lockf::Alarm moved to separate file, so PODs are now correct

1.17    2010-09-13
        * Ubic::Run: recognize RedHat init script names
        (thanks to Sawyer X for the patch, see http://github.com/berekuk/Ubic/issues/#issue/5)

         - minor logging cleanup
        * Ubic::Service::SimpleDaemon returns daemon pid in status msg
        * test improvements:
         - using Test::TCP when testing ubic-ping
         - watchdog.t skips all tests if 'fakeroot' is not present
        * Ubic::Cmd: print 'running' result as good when it contains extended message

1.15    2010-09-06
        * tests fixed to work under root user (http://github.com/berekuk/Ubic/issues#issue/4)

1.14    2010-09-02
        * handle supplementary groups correctly
        * ubic-watchdog doesn't require root privileges anymore (unless service requires them, of course)
        * repo and bugtracker resources in META.yml
        * PodWeaver in dist.ini config, so all modules now have proper AUTHOR and COPYRIGHT sections
        * SimpleDaemon and Common services accept arrayref as 'group' value

1.13    2010-09-01
        * Perl6::Slurp removed from dependencies
        * Ubic::Manual::FAQ now is actually added
        * group() method in services:
         - services can specify group(s) from which service should run, analogous to user() method
         - ubic will call setgid() before invoking any service methods
         - default group list consists only of main user's group, as returned by getpwnam; supplementary groups are not supported yet

        code when there are not errors

1.08    2010-08-03
        * bugfix: has_service for nested unexistent services
        * debian/ dir in distribution too

1.07    2010-07-30
