        * ubic-ping: 404 message content fixed
        * ubic-watchdog:
         - set check_timeout alarm a bit earlier
         - another alarm before compiling services

1.22    Sun Nov 07, 2010
        * Ubic::Multiservice:
         - default implementation of 'has_simple_service' method
         - POD improvements

1.21_01 Thu Oct 21, 2010
        * fixed races in t/daemon.t

1.21    Tue Oct 19, 2010
        * Ubic.pm:
         - set_ubic_dir() renamed to set_data_dir()
         (set_ubic_dir still remains in code for backward compatibility)
         - get_data_dir() and get_service_dir() methods
         - UBIC_LOCK_DIR, UBIC_TMP_DIR and UBIC_WATCHDOG_DIR env variables are deprecated;
         UBIC_DIR variable or set_data_dir() method should be used instead
         - bugfix in forked_call() method - it thrown "temp file not found after fork" exception occasionally in some cases
         - more consistent params validation in many methods
        * ubic-watchdog improvements:
         - separate non-blocking per-service lock (http://github.com/berekuk/ubic/issues#issue/1)
         - ubic-watchdog can now check selected set of services by name or glob
         - ubic-watchdog kills itself after $service->check_timeout() seconds
        * deprecated Ubic::Catalog module removed (it was renamed into Ubic::Multiservice long time ago)

        * documentation improvements

1.19    Tue Sep 14, 2010
        * ubic-watchdog always uses Ubic->status interface to check service status

1.18    Tue Sep 14, 2010
        * critical bugfix: ubic-watchdog correctly interpret extended statuses
        (thanks to Sawyer X for noticing this, see http://github.com/berekuk/Ubic/issues#issue/7)
        * Ubic::Lockf::Alarm moved to separate file, so PODs are now correct

1.17    Mon Sep 13, 2010
        * Ubic::Run: recognize RedHat init script names
        (thanks to Sawyer X for the patch, see http://github.com/berekuk/Ubic/issues/#issue/5)
        * test improvements:
         - ubic-ping uses Config.pm to determine full perl binary path
         - memory-leak.t is more robust

1.16    Tue Sep 07, 2010
        * Ubic::Daemon:
         - check_daemon() now returns proper Ubic::Daemon::Status object
         - don't log warning if daemon exited by sigterm
         - minor logging cleanup
        * Ubic::Service::SimpleDaemon returns daemon pid in status msg
        * test improvements:
         - using Test::TCP when testing ubic-ping
         - watchdog.t skips all tests if 'fakeroot' is not present
        * Ubic::Cmd: print 'running' result as good when it contains extended message

1.15    Mon Sep 06, 2010
        * tests fixed to work under root user (http://github.com/berekuk/Ubic/issues#issue/4)

1.14    Thu Sep 02, 2010
        * handle supplementary groups correctly
        * ubic-watchdog doesn't require root privileges anymore (unless service requires them, of course)
        * repo and bugtracker resources in META.yml
        * PodWeaver in dist.ini config, so all modules now have proper AUTHOR and COPYRIGHT sections
        * SimpleDaemon and Common services accept arrayref as 'group' value

1.13    Wed Sep 01, 2010
        * Perl6::Slurp removed from dependencies
        * Ubic::Manual::FAQ now is actually added
        * group() method in services:
         - services can specify group(s) from which service should run, analogous to user() method
         - ubic will call setgid() before invoking any service methods
         - default group list consists only of main user's group, as returned by getpwnam; supplementary groups are not supported yet

1.12    Thu Aug 26, 2010
