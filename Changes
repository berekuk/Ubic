        * critical bugfix: ubic-watchdog correctly interpret extended statuses
        (thanks to Sawyer X for noticing this, see http://github.com/berekuk/Ubic/issues#issue/7)

1.17    Mon Sep 13, 2010
        * Ubic::Run: recognize RedHat init script names
        (thanks to Sawyer X for the patch, see http://github.com/berekuk/Ubic/issues/#issue/5)
        * test improvements:
         - ubic-ping uses Config.pm to determine full perl binary path
         - memory-leak.t is more robust

1.16    Tue Sep 07, 2010
        * Ubic::Daemon:
         - check_daemon() now returns proper Ubic::Daemon::Status object
         - don't log warning if daemon exited by sigterm
         - minor logging cleanup
        * Ubic::Service::SimpleDaemon returns daemon pid in status msg
        * test improvements:
         - using Test::TCP when testing ubic-ping
         - watchdog.t skips all tests if 'fakeroot' is not present
        * Ubic::Cmd: print 'running' result as good when it contains extended message

1.15    Mon Sep 06, 2010
        * tests fixed to work under root user (http://github.com/berekuk/Ubic/issues#issue/4)

1.14    Thu Sep 02, 2010
        * handle supplementary groups correctly
        * ubic-watchdog doesn't require root privileges anymore (unless service requires them, of course)
        * repo and bugtracker resources in META.yml
        * PodWeaver in dist.ini config, so all modules now have proper AUTHOR and COPYRIGHT sections
        * SimpleDaemon and Common services accept arrayref as 'group' value

1.13    Wed Sep 01, 2010
        * Perl6::Slurp removed from dependencies
        * Ubic::Manual::FAQ now is actually added
        * group() method in services:
         - services can specify group(s) from which service should run, analogous to user() method
         - ubic will call setgid() before invoking any service methods
         - default group list consists only of main user's group, as returned by getpwnam; supplementary groups are not supported yet

        * bugfix: custom commands print 'ok' using green color and exit with zero
        code when there are not errors

1.08    Tue Aug 03, 2010
        * bugfix: has_service for nested unexistent services
        * debian/ dir in distribution too
