Revision history for Ubic

{{$NEXT}}
        * tests fixed to work under root user (http://github.com/berekuk/Ubic/issues#issue/4)

1.14    Thu Sep 02, 2010
        * handle supplementary groups correctly
        * ubic-watchdog doesn't require root privileges anymore (unless service requires them, of course)
        * repo and bugtracker resources in META.yml
        * PodWeaver in dist.ini config, so all modules now have proper AUTHOR and COPYRIGHT sections
        * SimpleDaemon and Common services accept arrayref as 'group' value

1.13    Wed Sep 01, 2010
        * Perl6::Slurp removed from dependencies
        * Ubic::Manual::FAQ now is actually added
        * group() method in services:
         - services can specify group(s) from which service should run, analogous to user() method
         - ubic will call setgid() before invoking any service methods
         - default group list consists only of main user's group, as returned by getpwnam; supplementary groups are not supported yet
